      "   * **Secure resources** – Apply for youth‑grant programmes, crowd‑fund, or tap into national SDG financing mechanisms.  \n",
      "   * **Set indicators** – Use the target’s quantitative indicator (e.g., number of households with reliable electricity).  \n",

      "| **1️⃣ Identify personal interests** | List topics you care about (e.g., climate, gender equality, tech, health, marine life). | Maps directly to one or more Goals (e.g., climate → Goal 13; gender → Goal 5). |\n",
      "| **2️⃣ Scan the target list** | Use the goal‑by‑goal tables above to find **specific targets** that mention your interest (e.g., “increase renewable‑energy share” = 7.2; “end child marriage” = 5.3). | Gives you a concrete, measurable entry point. |\n",
      "| **3️⃣ Look for synergies** | Spot where two or more targets overlap (e.g., 4.7 (education for sustainable development) + 13.3 (climate education) → joint school‑based climate‑learning projects). | Shows how one activity can advance several Goals at once. |\n",
      "| **4️⃣ Choose a “lead” target** | Pick one target you will focus on for a project or advocacy campaign. | Provides a clear objective and a set of indicators to track. |\n",
      "| **5️⃣ Build a partnership plan** | Identify who can help: schools, NGOs, local government, private firms, university labs, youth networks. | Aligns with Goal 17’s partnership framework. |\n",
      "| **6️⃣ Design a simple monitoring sheet** | List the target, its indicator, baseline data (if available), and a timeline for your activities. | Mirrors the global monitoring system and makes your impact visible. |\n",
      "| **7️⃣ Share & scale** | Publish results on social media, community boards, or a youth‑led SDG portal; invite other groups to replicate. | Fuels the “knowledge‑sharing” and “capacity‑building” loops of Goal 17. |\n",
      "\n",
      "**Example:**  \n",
      "A youth group passionate about clean water could adopt **Target 6.1** (universal safe water) and **Target 13.1** (climate‑resilient water systems). They might partner with a local NGO to install rain‑water harvesting kits, collect baseline data on household water access, and use the kits as a demonstration for climate‑adaptation workshops in schools (linking to Goal 4). Their progress would be reported in the community’s VNR, contributing to national data for 17.18.\n",

      "\n",
      "The 17 SDGs are a **systemic, inter‑linked roadmap**: each goal’s detailed targets act as building blocks that, when pursued together, eradicate poverty, hunger and inequality; guarantee health, education and gender equity; protect water, energy, climate, oceans and land; create livable cities; and are underpinned by robust financing, technology, capacity‑building, data and partnership mechanisms.  \n",
      "\n",
      "For youth, the process is simple: **pick the goal(s) that spark your passion, locate the concrete target(s), partner with the right stakeholders, measure your impact, and feed your results back into the global SDG monitoring system.** In doing so, you become an active agent in the 2030 Agenda and help ensure that **no one is left behind**.\n",
